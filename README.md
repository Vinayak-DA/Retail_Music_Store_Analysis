## Overview
This project is a deep dive into retail sales analytics using SQL. It explores transactional data, customer behavior, and sales trends to answer critical business questions. The analysis provides actionable insights to optimize sales strategies, customer engagement, and revenue growth.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Sales Performance Analysis:** Extracted key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, average invoice value, and best-performing regions.
- **Customer Insights & Segmentation:** Identified high-value customers and their purchasing patterns.
- **Product & Genre Trends:** Analyzed top-selling music genres and artists based on customer purchases.
- **Advanced SQL Querying Techniques:** Used `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and recursive queries.
- **Optimized Query Performance:** Implemented indexing strategies and query optimization techniques to enhance efficiency.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Total Revenue:** Sum of all invoices.
- **Average Invoice Value:** Mean of total invoice amounts.
- **Top-Selling Products & Genres:** Most purchased products based on quantity and revenue.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Total spending per customer.

- Identifying top-spending customers by country.

### 3. Advanced-Level Queries
- Calculating the total amount spent by each customer on top-selling artists.
- Determining the most popular music genre per country.
- Finding the highest-spending customer per country.
- Using recursive queries for advanced customer segmentation.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL Database:** Analyzed data stored in a structured relational database.
- **SQL Techniques:** Applied `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `CTE`, `Recursive Queries`, and Aggregations.
- **Data Modeling & Analysis:** Processed sales, invoice, and customer data for meaningful insights.
